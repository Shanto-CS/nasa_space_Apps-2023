2023 NASA Space Apps Challenge

Summary
Are we alone in the universe? To address this question, NASAâ€™s next flagship space telescope, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), will search for habitable planets
beyond our solar system. What do you think these worlds will look like? Your challenge is to use publicly available information on habitable worlds to design your own
habitable world and write about what life might be like on it.
