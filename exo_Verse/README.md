This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- **By using NASA provided informations we have developed this user friendly web application Exoverse where we have included 10 sections.**
  **High-Level Summary**
We not only just think about science, we but also prioritizes people's imagination. This idea will change how we explore and interact with habitable worlds beyond Earth .This web application lets you imagine and design habitable worlds and connect with others who share your excitement about space. This web application affects space enthusiasts, dreamers, and anyone curious about what's out there beyond our Earth. It's about making space exploration personal and accessible to everyone, inspiring us to look up at the stars and wonder what's out there.

**Project Details**
Our project Exoverse, centered around newly discovered habitable world like which represents a significant leap forward in humanity's quest to answer the age-old question of whether we are alone in the universe. By leveraging the Habitable Worlds Observatory(HWO), our initiative aims to assess habitability, establish interstellar cooperation and efficiently conduct investigations. These given habitable planets are in strategic location and potential for liquid water which makes it a promising candidate for human habitation and future exploration. The possibilities for a harmonious coexistence between humans and any intelligent life forms on these planets are both exciting and profound, opening up new horizons for humanity's future beyond Earth. The Habitable Worlds Observatory(HWO) will be the key to unlocking the mysteries and potential of this kind of distant world, offering boundless opportunities for scientific discovery and the expansion of our species into the cosmos.

This idea will change how we explore and interact with habitable worlds beyond Earth. It allows people to imagine and design these worlds, fostering creativity and excitement about space exploration.
